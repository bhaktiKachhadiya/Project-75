  <p class="list-group-item col-md 20">The nature of Christian schools varies enormously from country to country, according to the religious, educational, and political cultures. In some countries, there is a strict separation of church and state, so all religious schools are private; in others, there is an established church whose teachings form an integral part of the state-operated educational system; in yet others, the state subsidizes religious schools of various denominations</p>

    <p class="list-group-item col-md 20">A school library (or a school library media center) is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology."[1] A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering."</p>

      <p class="list-group-item col-md 20">An auditorium is a room built to enable an audience to hear and watch performances.

Auditoria can be found in entertainment venues, community halls, and theaters, and may be used for rehearsal, presentation, performing arts productions, or as a learning space.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Onile Attendance Management System</h4>
  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Attendance is one of those administrative tasks that must be done at the start of each class. It can take up valuable time at the beginning of class and sometimes be difficult to manage. Attendance books traditionally are big grids with tiny squares that are hard to read and can be easy to make errors in. With QuickSchools' Online Student Information System (also known as Online School Management System), taking and managing attendance is no longer a hassle with our easy to use and robust school attendance system. The easy to use online student attendance system designed by QuickSchools make taking attendance quick and less prone to errors. Record a studentâ€™s attendance on the colored chart with a click of the mouse. The information pertaining to the student attendance can then be immediately shared with parents via cloud (i.e., online) to help them keep track of their students via our online school management system.
